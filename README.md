# Quiz-Maker
Codoffee Quiz Maker is the first project that we did years ago in our startup codoffee(which dismissed in early 2020) I did parts of it as i was 13-y.o by the time it was being done for our schools celebration(competetion actually) and it won. In this repository i'll present you with it's full codec + how to run it + the full manual of software. The main work that the program was foucesd on, is that in the UI of software you shall proceed with 2 type of accounts, One is for the Teacher and the other is for Student. The Teacher can design exams with 2 diffrent type(test or discreptive) and after he designed, he will upload the file of exam(.QME) to our cloud service; After that any student can access the exam with giving the program, teacher's codoffee ID!
